# A simple sample for sending messages between endpoints

The `Client` project sends a command to `Queue1` and shuts down.

`Queue1` handles the command and sends another command to `Queue2`

`Queue2` handles the final command.


Using the term `Queue` instead of `Endpoint` to match terminology used in a support case.
